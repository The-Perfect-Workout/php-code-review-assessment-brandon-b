## Language & Tools

- PHP 8.2
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - as a dependency manager for PHP
- [CakePHP 2.x](https://book.cakephp.org/2/en/index.html) - PHP framework for web applications
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for the database
- [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for unit tests

Before continuing to the next steps, you'll need PHP 8.2 and Composer installed on your computer. The other tools will be installed with Composer.

### Assessment Instructions
Please conduct a code review of the pull request. You will be assessed on your ability to identify issues related to code quality, efficiency, user experience, and bugs in the code.
There are no "gotchas" or right or wrong answers, we are simply looking for your capacity to review PHP code and make concise comments and suggestions.

### Project Setup

The following instructions are used to run and use the application. These instructions are written for a Mac/Linux/WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment with PHP 8.2 installed. If you are running on Windows and not using WSL, you might need to modify the commands slightly.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ composer install

# Run a local web server
$ php -S localhost:8000

# Initialize the database
$ http://localhost:8000/data/initialize

# Run tests for the example scenario
$ ./lib/Cake/Console/cake test app/Test/Case/Lib/PayrollNotificationsLibTest.php --stderr --verbose
```
